# üé¨ Quick Start for Next Phase

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1: API Foundation)

1. **Create API Route Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/routes/api/v1/{requests,driver,auth}
   ```

2. **Design API Response Format**
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/server/api/response.ts
   interface ApiResponse<T> {
     success: boolean;
     data?: T;
     error?: {
       code: string;
       message: string;
     };
     meta?: {
       page?: number;
       limit?: number;
       total?: number;
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Create Authentication Middleware**
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/server/api/auth.ts
   export async function requireAuth(event: RequestEvent) {
     const token = event.request.headers.get('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
     if (!token) throw error(401, 'Unauthorized');
     // Validate JWT token from SSO
   }
   ```

4. **Start with Transportation Request Endpoint**
   ```typescript
   // src/routes/api/v1/requests/transport/+server.ts
   export async function POST({ request, locals }) {
     // Create transport request
   }

   export async function GET({ url, locals }) {
     // List transport requests with filters
   }
   ```

5. **Update Database Schemas**
   - Add `facilityRequests` collection schema
   - Add `driverLocations` collection for GPS tracking
   - Add `tripEvents` collection for ATA/ATD logs

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Android instead of Arduino?
1. ‚úÖ **Lower Hardware Cost**: Android phones vs Arduino + GPS + SIM card
2. ‚úÖ **Better UX**: Drivers can interact with app (confirmations, status updates)
3. ‚úÖ **Simpler Deployment**: No hardware installation required
4. ‚úÖ **Real-time Communication**: Push notifications, chat with admin
5. ‚úÖ **Dual Purpose**: Navigation + tracking in one device

### API-First Design
- Web app and mobile apps share the same backend API
- Easy to add more clients (iOS, desktop) in the future
- Clear separation of concerns

### Authentication Strategy
- All apps use Aksara SSO via OAuth 2.0
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Refresh token mechanism for mobile apps

# Objective

- **Manage Employee Transportation Support**:
    - Admin need to allocate voucher(from Transportation Company/Go-Car) from employee request.
    - Admin need to schedule driver and car to transport employee based on empleyee booking.
    - having dashboard of assets(car/driver) and voucher utilization to support employee productivity
    - we will install arduino with GPS and OBD reader on each car(but what about BYD ev, is it will be different?)
- **Meeting Booking**:
    - admin need to manage booking to create (link for on-line meeting), or prepare physical room, facility, snack/lunch (for off-line meeting)
    - global admin need to see utilization of license, or facility of organisation meeting.
    - admin is regionally scooped (may have many location to manage)
    - tablet/raspberry pi zero w will be placed on in front of each rooms for displaying meeting title, and meeting attendance confirmation
- can be implemented for multi-entities company(Holding and its subsidiaries)
