# Summary: Room Display System

I've successfully created a complete room display system for your meeting room tablets/monitors. Here's what was implemented:

## 1. API Endpoint for Room Schedule

  File: src/routes/api/v1/rooms/[id]/schedule/+server.ts

  Features:
  - Fetches room details by ID
  - Gets today's schedule with all bookings
  - Identifies current meeting (if any)
  - Finds next meeting
  - Calculates room availability status
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

  Endpoint: GET /api/v1/rooms/{roomId}/schedule

  Response includes:
  - Room information (name, capacity, facilities)
  - Current meeting details
  - Next meeting details
  - Full day's schedule
  - Availability status
  - Available until time

## 2. Enhanced Room Display Page

  Updates:
  - âœ… Connected to real API (replaced mock data)
  - âœ… Real-time clock display
  - âœ… Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
  - âœ… Loading state with spinner
  - âœ… Error handling with retry button
  - âœ… Three status modes:
    - Available (green) - Room is free
    - Occupied (red) - Meeting in progress
    - Upcoming (orange) - Meeting starting within 30 min

  Display Features:
  - Large status indicator with icon
  - Current meeting details (title, organizer, time, participants)
  - Next meeting preview
  - Complete today's schedule
  - Check-in button (for future implementation)

## 3. Room Display Management Page

  File: src/routes/admin/room-displays/+page.svelte

  Features:
  - Lists all meeting rooms
  - Generates QR codes for each room display URL
  - Displays room information (name, number, floor, capacity, status)
  - Copy URL to clipboard
  - Preview display link
  - Print all QR codes function (for physical posting)

  QR Codes:
  - Generated using free QR Server API
  - 300x300 pixel size
  - Encoded with full display URL
  - Ready to print and mount outside rooms

## 4. Admin Dashboard Integration

  - Added "Room Displays" card to admin dashboard
  - Added link to admin navigation dropdown

  How to Use:

  For Room Displays (Tablets/Raspberry Pi):

  2. Or scan the QR code with the tablet
  3. The display will show:
    - Current room status (Available/Occupied/Upcoming)

  4. Display auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

  Display URL Format:

  Example: https://your-domain.com/display/room/6789abcdef123456

  Features for Tablets/Displays:

  Setup Instructions for Tablets:

    - Copy the display URL
  2. Configure Tablet/Raspberry Pi:
    - Open the display URL in kiosk mode
    - Set to full-screen
    - Disable sleep mode
    - Enable auto-start on boot (optional)
  3. Mount QR Code:
    - Print the QR code from admin page
    - Laminate it (recommended)
    - Mount outside the meeting room
    - Users can scan to see room status on mobile

  Testing:

  To test the display system:
  1. Make sure your database is seeded: bun run db:seed
  2. Navigate to /admin/room-displays
  3. Click "Preview Display" on any room
  4. You should see the display page with the room's schedule

  File Structure:

  src/routes/
  â”œâ”€â”€ api/rooms/[id]/schedule/+server.ts    # API endpoint
  â”œâ”€â”€ display/room/[roomId]/+page.svelte    # Display page (updated)
  â””â”€â”€ admin/room-displays/+page.svelte      # QR code management

  The room display system is now fully functional and ready to be deployed on tablets or Raspberry Pi devices! ðŸŽ‰
