## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Approval Workflow (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Make transportation requests actionable

1. ✅ **Pending Requests Page** (`/admin/transportation/pending`)

3. ✅ **Voucher Allocation**
   - Auto-assign available voucher code when approving voucher request
   - Update voucher status from `available` → `used`
   - Link voucher to request (`requestId` field)
   - Handle round trips (allocate 2 vouchers)

4. ✅ **Car/Driver Availability Check**
   - Query available vehicles for date/time
   - Check driver shifts and availability
   - Match vehicle capacity to passenger count

9. ✅ **Calendar Invite (.ics file)**
   - Generate .ics file with meeting details
   - Send via email to all participants
   - Include Zoom/Teams link if hybrid

## 🔄 Business Process Updates Needed

### Current Gaps in Documentation

The flowcharts don't mention these implemented features:
1. **Trip Purpose Selection** - For analytics and reporting
2. **Driver Wait/Drop Condition** - Business decision on driver utilization
3. **Round Trip Support** - Allocates 2 vouchers automatically
4. **Map-based Location Picker** - For accurate addresses
5. **Voucher CSV Import/Export** - For billing reconciliation

**Recommendation:** Update BUSINESS_PROCESS.md to include these steps in the flowchart.

### Ambiguities to Clarify

1. **Voucher Distribution Method:**
   - Email the code to employee?
   - Display in web app?
   - Push notification?
   - **Recommendation:** All of the above for redundancy

2. **Driver Notification Timing:**
   - Immediately upon approval?
   - X hours before trip?
   - **Recommendation:** Both (immediate + reminder 2 hours before)

3. **Alternative Offer Workflow:**
   - Auto-offer voucher or require admin decision?
   - **Recommendation:** Admin decides, system suggests

4. **Trip Completion Criteria:**
   - Driver confirms in app?
   - Auto-complete after X hours?
   - **Recommendation:** Driver confirms + auto-complete after 12 hours

5. **Meeting Approval Rules:**
   - All meetings need approval or only certain types?
   - **Recommendation:** Configurable per room (VIP rooms need approval)
